## Investigative and Legislative Matters

Stuntz Strategies provides experienced, knowledgeable, and objective strategic and tactical advice drawing in large part on eighteen years as a House Energy and Commerce Committee staffer, and on another seventeen years as an attorney working on congressional and other government investigations.

For fourteen years of his tenure on the Hill, Reid Stuntz worked with Chairman, and later Ranking Member, John D. Dingell on a daily basis as Staff Director â€“ first for the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations (holding 80 investigative hearings in four years) and then for the Full Committee for ten years.

After leaving federal service in early 2007, Reid joined Hogan and Hartson (now Hogan Lovells) as a partner, and became Of Counsel to that firm in late 2009.  He was co-leader of the Congressional Investigations practice (working with over 30 clients on investigations by nine different committees) and worked on many government relations matters (for more than 20 clients) with the Legislative Group.

Reid left the practice of law in December 2014, and established Stuntz Strategies in January 2015 to focus on political and communications challenges posed by congressional investigations, and on issues before the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.
